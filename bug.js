This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and it's related to the way keys are generated or managed for items in the list.  The most common cause is using an index as the key, like this:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={myArray}
  renderItem={({item, index}) => <MyComponent item={item} key={index} />}
/>
```

Using the index as a key is problematic because React Native might reuse the same index for different items as the data changes, leading to incorrect rendering or unexpected behavior.  This often manifests as items not updating correctly, flickering, or showing incorrect data.  The symptoms can vary depending on how your data is changing.
